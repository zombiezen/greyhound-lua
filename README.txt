About FIRST Lua
=================

FIRST Lua is a distribution of `Lua`_ intended to be used for the `FIRST
Robotics Competition`_.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in Lua, a
simple, lightweight programming language.

Features
==========

*  `Lua`_ is simple to learn and easy to maintain.
*  FIRST Lua lets you reload code without restarting.
*  FIRST Lua provides access to the WPILib.
*  You don't need to use WindRiver once the base code is installed.
*  Inclusion of the `bitop`_ library.

Installation
==============

Open the project directory as a WindRiver project.  Build the project and
download the code to your robot.  Now you have the Lua interpreter on the robot,
now let's add some code.

Connect to your robot's IP with an FTP client (e.g. ``ftp://10.XX.YY.2/``, where
XXYY is your team number).  Copy the ``samples/boot.lua`` file in the FIRSTLua
distribution to ``lua/boot.lua`` on the robot.  This is the bootloader which
will run the rest of your code; you shouldn't need to edit it.

Writing Code
==============

The default Lua bootloader will load ``lua/robot.lua`` and try to call a
function called ``run`` in there.  This assumes that you are using the standard
Lua packaging system (i.e. using the ``module`` function).  A basic
``robot.lua`` file may look like this::

   -- samples/template/robot.lua
   module(..., package.seeall)
   
   function run()
      -- Main loop
      while true do
         if wpilib.IsDisabled() then
            disabled()
            repeat wpilib.Wait(0.01) until not wpilib.IsDisabled()
         elseif wpilib.IsAutonomous() then
            autonomous()
            repeat wpilib.Wait(0.01) until not wpilib.IsAutonomous() or not wpilib.IsEnabled()
         else
            teleop()
            repeat wpilib.Wait(0.01) until not wpilib.IsOperatorControl() or not wpilib.IsEnabled()
         end
      end
   end

   function teleop()
      while wpilib.IsOperatorControl() and wpilib.IsEnabled() do
         -- Run one cycle of teleoperated here...
         wpilib.Wait(0.01)
      end
   end

   function autonomous()
      -- Run autonomous code here...
   end
   
   function disabled()
      -- Do something in disabled mode here...
   end

You can find more examples of code in the ``samples`` directory.

Technical Overview
====================

FIRST Lua is a packaging of a patched `Lua`_ 5.1.4 interpreter (found in the
``lua`` subdirectory).  All access to the WPILib is generated by a `SWIG`_
interface, which is found at ``wpilib.i``.  When the robot is started, it calls
upon the LuaRobot class to set up the environment, which creates a Lua state
and runs the file ``lua/boot.lua``.  From there, all responsibility is given to
the ``boot.lua`` script, which is referred to as the bootloader.

Major Differences from standard Lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  No dynamic loading of C code.  vxWorks does have the capability for it, but
   we haven't seen a need to introduce the complexity.  The ``loadlib`` family
   of functions remain, but they will give an error.  This restriction may be
   lifted eventually.
*  The `bitop`_ library is bundled with this project (as ``bit.c``).
*  Some functions from ``os`` are removed, namely:
   *  ``os.execute``
   *  ``os.exit``
   *  ``os.setlocale``
