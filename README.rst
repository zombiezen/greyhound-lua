About Greyhound Lua
=====================

Greyhound Lua is a distribution of `Lua`_ intended to be used for the `FIRST
Robotics Competition`_.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in Lua, a
simple, lightweight programming language.

Greyhound Lua is in no way endorsed or sponsored by US FIRST.

Features
==========

*  `Lua`_ is simple to learn and easy to maintain.
*  Greyhound Lua lets you reload code without restarting.
*  Greyhound Lua provides access to the WPILib.
*  You don't need to use WindRiver once the base code is installed.
*  Inclusion of the `bitop`_ library.

Getting Started
=================

The `Greyhound Lua Wiki`_ is the best place for up-to-date documentation and
resources for Greyhound Lua.  You can also find examples of code in the
``samples`` directory.

Technical Overview
====================

Greyhound Lua is a packaging of a patched `Lua`_ 5.1.4 interpreter (found in the
``lua`` subdirectory).  All access to the WPILib is generated by a `SWIG`_
interface, which is found at ``wpilib.i``.  When the robot is started, it calls
upon the LuaRobot class to set up the environment, which creates a Lua state
and runs the file ``lua/boot.lua``.  From there, all responsibility is given to
the ``boot.lua`` script, which is referred to as the bootloader.

Major Differences from standard Lua
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  No dynamic loading of C code.  vxWorks does have the capability for it, but
   we haven't seen a need to introduce the complexity.  The ``loadlib`` family
   of functions remain, but they will give an error.  This restriction may be
   lifted eventually.
*  The `bitop`_ library is bundled with this project (as ``bit.c``).
*  Some functions from ``os`` are removed, namely:

   *  ``os.execute``
   *  ``os.exit``
   *  ``os.setlocale``
